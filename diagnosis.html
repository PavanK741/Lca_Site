        <h1>How is lung cancer diagnosed and managed?</h1>
        Usually, concern that a patient may have lung cancer starts as an abnormal finding on a chest imaging study
        (chest
        X-ray or CT scan) or when the disease is advanced enough to cause symptoms, such as coughing, shortness of
        breath,
        chest pain, fatigue and/or weight loss.

        Diagnosis requires a biopsy, or the removal of cells or tissues from the suspicious mass. Biopsies can be
        performed
        through a camera fed through the breathing tubes (called bronchoscopy) or from a needle inserted through the
        skin
        into the lung tumor. If these approaches are not successful, surgery may be required for an adequate diagnosis.
        The
        biopsy is important in determining whether or not it is cancer, and to determine which type of lung cancer.

        <h3>Clinical trials</h3>
        For some patients, participating in a clinical trial may be a treatment choice. Clinical trials are done to find
        out
        if new cancer treatments are safe and effective, or to see if they are better than the standard treatment. Many
        of
        today’s standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a
        clinical
        trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a prospective new treatment.

        Patients who take part in clinical tri3ls also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even
        when
        clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and move medical
        knowledge forward.

        <h3>Lung cancer screening</h3>
        Lung cancer screening refers to testing a healthy individual at high risk for developing lung cancer who has no
        symptoms of lung cancer to find lung cancer at a stage that it can be better treated. Low-dose chest CT based
        screening has been found to reduce the number of people who die from lung cancer with acceptable risks when
        performed in a high quality setting. At Cleveland Clinic, we have a comprehensive lung cancer screening program
        for
        those individuals at high risk of developing lung cancer (aged 55 to 77, 30+ pack-years of smoking, smoked
        within
        the past 15 years).</p>

        <h1>How is lung cancer treated?</h1>
        All relevant information about the patient, including his or her health status, the kind of tumor and how far it
        has
        spread are brought together to design the most appropriate therapy for that individual’s cancer.

        Lung cancer is a very challenging cancer to treat. Cell type and stage are the most critical factors in
        determining
        the survival rate is the stage at the time of diagnosis. Those that are diagnosed at a localized stage may be
        curable. Unfortunately, most people are diagnosed when the disease has spread outside the chest (advanced or
        distant) or involves the nodes in the chest (regional). Also, the lungs are very sensitive organs and may not
        handle
        some forms of treatment easily. This combination explains why lung cancer has one of the poorest survival rates
        of
        all cancers. The overall two-year survival rate of those diagnosed with lung cancer is 25%. At five years,
        survival
        rate drops to 15%.

        It is important to discuss the goals of lung cancer treatment with your doctor. Some treatments may be used to
        control the cancer. Others are used to improve quality of life and/or reduce symptoms. These treatments may be
        used
        alone or in combination.

        <h3>Chemotherapy and targeted therapies</h3>
        Chemotherapy is the use of drugs that are designed to kill rapidly growing cells, such as cancer cells.
        Chemotherapy
        may be injected directly into a vein (by IV, or intravenously) or given through a catheter, which is a thin tube
        placed into a large vein and kept there until it is no longer needed. Some chemotherapy drugs are taken orally
        in
        pill form.

        Targeted agents are a newer class of drugs that are designed to act against specific weaknesses in cancer cells
        or
        surrounding supportive tissues, such as blood vessels. These drugs can also be taken orally or by IV. They are
        most
        effective in cancers with specific changes in their genes or cell receptors.

        In early stages of non-small cell cancer, chemotherapy may be used in conjunction with surgery to improve
        survival
        rates. In more advanced stages of non-small cell cancer and in all stages of small cell cancer, chemotherapy and
        targeted therapies may be used to relieve symptoms and extend life.

        Chemotherapy affects both normal cells and cancer cells. Your doctors will try to prevent side effects as much
        as
        possible while treating the cancer appropriately. Side effects depend largely on the specific type of drug and
        the
        amount given. They can be different for each person and may be only temporary. Common side effects of
        chemotherapy
        include nausea and vomiting, hair loss, mouth sores and/ or fatigue. Your healthcare providers can suggest ways
        to
        make any side effects manageable and to help improve symptoms that may occur during and after procedures.

        <h3>Radiation therapy</h3>
        Radiation therapy is a form of high energy X-ray that kills cancer cells. It can be used as a primary treatment,
        or
        in combination with chemotherapy (with or without surgery). It often can play an important role in advanced
        cancer
        patients by providing relief from pain, blockage of the airways, shortness of breath or coughing.

        Radiation therapy is a “focused” treatment, meaning it is designed to maximize its effect on the cancer cells
        while
        minimizing injury to normal cells. Radiation to treat lung cancer most often comes from a machine (external
        radiation). Occasionally, the radiation may be delivered internally using tubes that place a radioactive seed
        directly near the tumor (internal radiation or brachytherapy).

        Side effects of radiation therapy depend mainly on the part of the body that is treated and the treatment dose.
        Common side effects of radiation therapy to the chest are a dry, sore throat; difficulty swallowing; fatigue;
        skin
        changes at the site of treatment; and/or loss of appetite.

        An area of particular innovation in radiation therapy is a high-technology approach, sometimes termed
        “radiosurgery.” In very select patients who have small tumors but for whom surgery is not desired or is unsafe,
        radiosurgery using very high doses of precisely focused radiation aimed only at the small tumor in the lung, is
        an
        effective alternative.

        <h3>Surgery</h3>
        Surgery is still considered the “gold standard” for treating early-stage lung cancer. Removing the tumor and
        surrounding lung tissue gives the best chance for cure for patients whose disease is localized. Surgery should
        be
        performed by specialized thoracic surgeons with particular expertise in treatment of lung cancer and other chest
        malignancies. Your surgeon will determine whether a tumor is resectable (removable). Not all tumors are
        resectable
        due to their location near, or if they have invaded, vital structures.

        In patients with multiple medical problems or poor lung function, surgery may not be the best option. This is
        carefully determined by our multidisciplinary team including pulmonologists, medical oncologists, and radiation
        oncologists who work collaboratively daily.

    <div class="text">
        <h1>What types of surgery are used to treat lung cancer?</h1>
        How much lung tissue will be removed and what type of surgical approach will be used depends on where the tumor
        is
        located in the lung, its size, patient’s body type/weight and any previous chest surgeries. When resection is
        needed, minimally invasive approaches are considered. Trained thoracic surgeons may perform video-assisted
        thoracic
        surgery (VATS) and VATS lobectomy routinely as well as robotic surgery. Surgical resection of lung cancer is
        generally performed as:

        <h3>Limited resection:</h3> An operation to remove only a small portion of the lung is called a segmental or
        wedge
        resection.
        <h3>Lobectomy:</h3> Removal of a defined section of the lung, (there are three lobes of the lung on the right
        and
        two on the left), is a lobectomy. This is the most common surgery performed for lung cancer.
        <h3>Pneumonectomy:</h3> The removal of an entire lung is called a pneumonectomy.
        Recovery after thoracic surgery depends on the extent of the surgery, whether or not it is performed minimally
        invasively, as well as the age and overall fitness of the patient. Many patients return home within three to
        four
        days after surgery. Patients who undergo minimally invasive surgery can generally return to work three weeks
        after
        surgery.

        <h1>What other services are offered to people with lung cancer?</h1>
        <h3>Pulmonary rehabilitation</h3>
        Chronic diseases and disorders of the lungs and airways, as well as some of the invasive treatments for them,
        can
        take their toll on health and quality of life. Pulmonary rehabilitation programs use an array of tactics – from
        education and exercise to encouraging lifestyle changes – to help our patients manage their conditions.

        <h3>Pain management</h3>
        Pain can be a significant issue for people undergoing cancer treatment. Various cancer interventions, as well as
        the
        cancer itself, can cause pain. Effective pain management can help maintain or improve quality of life and reduce
        the
        risk of depression associated with pain.

        <h3>Smoking cessation</h3>
        Smoking is a major cause of lung cancer, but quitting can be a challenging proposition for some chronic smokers.
        As
        smoking patterns vary from person to person, there is no “best” method for quitting. The most successful smoking
        cessation programs offer smokers a range of strategies.</p>

        <h1>How can I prevent lung cancer?</h1>
        There is no absolute way to prevent lung cancer. However, there are things that will lower your risk.


        <ul>
            <li>Do not smoke. If you do smoke, quit. Avoid breathing in smoke from people who do smoke.
            </li>
            <li>Reduce your exposure to chemicals known to cause cancer, such as:
                Arsenic, Asbestos, Beryllium, Cadmium and Substances containing nickel or chromium</li>
            <li>Avoid using Coal products</li>
            <li>Air pollution, such as exhaust from diesel engines</li>
            <li>Radon. Have your home tested for radon, a radioactive gas that has no color or odor.</li>
            <li>Eat a healthy diet.</li>
            <li>Exercise regularly.</li>

        </ul>
